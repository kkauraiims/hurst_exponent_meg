# hurst_exponent_meg
This repository contains a set of scripts for pre-processing, beamforming and hurst exponent analysis of magnetoencephalography data in FieldTrip (MATLAB)
Description: 

# coregister_ft_he_kk 
This is a custom function to co-register Elekta MEG data with individual MRI. This serves as the first step in computing the Hurst Exponent for every MRI co-registered virtual electrode in MEG
-requires manual input
-currently coded for '.mgz' MRI files only (can be changed for other file types as needed) 
-typical run time - 15-20 minutes/ subject
